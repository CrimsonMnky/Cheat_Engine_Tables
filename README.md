# CheatEngineTables

Repository of tables for CheatEngine

# To the Media Companies

We are still filtering through the tables that were found on the cheat engine forums. Our goal is to have only tables for offline gaming modes that help the gameplay only. If you find a table that does anything but modifies offline difficulty, please, let us know and we will remove them.

# Looking for maintainers

This is a very big data dump, and we'd love some help to filter out through malicious / useless tables. Please volunteer!
